-Activity: this describes the activity that the individual was performing at the evaluation moment. 
Six activities were registered: sitting, walking, standing, layind, climbing upstairs and downstairs

-Variable: This describes the variable which is evaluated. It only includes means and standard deviations. To further understand the variables nature, consult Anguita et al (2012).

-Value: The numerical value associated to the described variable. Again, only means and standard deviations are present.
